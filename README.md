## Animal Parser

Parses the website http://studio-evenaar.nl/parken/register.php and follows all links to retrieve the correct Dutch name of a lot of animals.

This code is created to give me a competitive advantage in the Dutch children's game "Dierenslang", which for some reason me and my friends play way to hardcore right now.

Current plan is to create a graph with all 26 letters as nodes, and animals as vertices to connect them.
